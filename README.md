 - `pip install computercraft` Will get us release `0.3.0` which does not have arguments working... at all... i checked the source code (master branch does seem to have them put intalling an unstable version of it might be risky .-.)
  - So... Build an argument parser as a runnable module as in get_args() which will await user input (calling `input()` in python does this :D)
  - Next... Ability to procedurally add variables/go back on mistakes
  - Meanwhile... Add parameter checking, the param retrieval can be done in a loop until all args are valid or user exited(how? dunno :c) ...
